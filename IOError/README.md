# IOError - General Input/Output Errors

`IOError` occurs when an input/output operation fails for an I/O-related reason. This could involve file operations like reading or writing to a file, network communication, or any other I/O activity. It is a built-in exception that is raised in such scenarios.

In Python 3, `IOError` has been merged into the `OSError` exception. However, it is still commonly encountered in legacy code and certain specific contexts.

## Common Causes

1. **File Not Found**: Attempting to open a file that does not exist.
2. **Permission Denied**: Insufficient permissions to read from or write to a file.
3. **Disk Full**: The storage device is full, preventing write operations.
4. **Network Errors**: Issues with network connectivity or communication during network I/O operations.
5. **File Corruption**: Trying to read from or write to a corrupted file.
6. **Device Errors**: Hardware-related issues, such as a malfunctioning disk drive.

## Example

### Cause: File Not Found

```python
try:
    with open('non_existent_file.txt', 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
except IOError as e:
    print(f"An IOError occurred: {e}")
```

### Cause: Permission Denied

```python
try:
    with open('/restricted_access_file.txt', 'w') as file:
        file.write("Hello, World!")
except IOError as e:
    print(f"An IOError occurred: {e}")
```

## Solutions

### Check File Existence

Before performing file operations, ensure that the file exists:

```python
import os

if os.path.exists('file.txt'):
    with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
else:
    print("File not found.")
```

### Handle Permissions

Ensure your script has the necessary permissions to access the file. If you're running on a Unix-like system, you might need to change file permissions using `chmod`:

```sh
chmod 644 file.txt
```

Or handle the permission error gracefully in your code:

```python
try:
    with open('/restricted_access_file.txt', 'w') as file:
        file.write("Hello, World!")
except IOError as e:
    if e.errno == 13:
        print("Permission denied. Try running the script with appropriate permissions.")
    else:
        print(f"An IOError occurred: {e}")
```

### Ensure Sufficient Disk Space

Before writing to a file, ensure there is enough disk space. This can be checked manually or by using system commands. However, Python does not have a built-in way to check disk space directly.

### Network Resilience

For network-related I/O operations, implement retry logic and handle potential network failures:

```python
import requests
from requests.exceptions import IOError

url = "https://example.com/data"
try:
    response = requests.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    data = response.text
except IOError as e:
    print(f"An IOError occurred: {e}")
```
